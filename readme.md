## Description

_{ App to show pictures sliding into view as the page is scrolled. Pictures are hidden on load and 30% off screen via css. When a picture is 50% on the screen the image is made visible and moved into place. When the picture is 50% off the screen it is hidden and moved back to 30% off the screen. There is also a bounce function that wraps the image showing function. Bounce limits the number of calls made by window to improve performance for the rest of the page and its features. This can lead to slightly slower response time for images being moved on/off the page.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_{Download the files and open index.html. Scroll up and down the page to see the images come in and out. Make sure you have javascript enabled or the images will not be visible as they are hidden by CSS.}_

## Known Bugs

_{None that I am aware of. }_
